pidgin-git-import is a project that provides simple scripts to convert pidgin's
mtn repository to git.

Since it uses mtn's git_export the end result is guaranteed to be an
almost-exact replica of the original repo. You'll need a very recent version of
monotone: 0.46.

If you don't have the pidgin mtn repository:

 $ ./init

Otherwise, just

 $ ./import
